        run: python github_upload.py
```

### Step 4: Add Files to Your Repository
1. **Manually via GitHub**:
   - Go to `https://github.com/chreid1973/fknws`.
   - Click **Add file** > **Create new file**.
   - For `github_upload.py`:
     - Name: `github_upload.py`.
     - Paste the Python script content.
     - Commit to the `main` branch.
   - For `daily-upload.yml`:
     - Name: `.github/workflows/daily-upload.yml`.
     - Paste the YAML content.
     - Commit to the `main` branch.
2. **Or via Git CLI**:
   - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/chreid1973/fknws.git`.
   - Create `github_upload.py` and `.github/workflows/daily-upload.yml` locally with the respective contents.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git add github_upload.py .github/workflows/daily-upload.yml
     git commit -m "Add automated fake news upload script and workflow"
     git push origin main
     ```

### Step 5: Verify Automation
- **Timestamp**: Starting October 22, 2025, 9:00 AM CST
- The workflow will run daily at 9 AM CST, uploading or updating `fake_news_groks_gems.md`.
- You can also trigger it manually:
  - Go to `https://github.com/chreid1973/fknws` > **Actions** > **Daily Fake News Upload** > **Run workflow**.
- Check the **Actions** tab for logs to confirm it ran successfully.

### Notes
- **Time Zone Confirmation**: I assumed CST (UTC-5). If youâ€™re in a different time zone, let me know (e.g., PST, EST), and Iâ€™ll adjust the cron schedule (`0 14 * * *`).
- **Dynamic Content**: The script currently uses static content. If you want it to generate new fake news stories daily, I can modify it to call an API or generate content dynamically (though this may require additional setup).
- **Repo Status**: Based on our conversation on October 7, 2025, 22:24 PM CST, your `Lumen` repo was empty, but I assume `fknws` is set up. If itâ€™s not, create it at `github.com/new`.

Let me know if you need a different time zone, want to add dynamic story generation, or prefer a local scheduler (e.g., Cron or Task Scheduler) instead! ðŸ˜„
